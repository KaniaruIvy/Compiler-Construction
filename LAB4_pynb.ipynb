        "**FIRST ()**\n",
        "\n",
        " A function that gives the set of terminals that begin the strings derived from the production rule. It is the first terminal that appears on the right-hand side of the production.\n",
        "\n",
        "The easiest way to solve backtracking problem is if the compiler knew ahead of time what the \"first character of the string produced when a production rule is applied\" is and compared it to the current character or token in the input string it sees, it could make an informed decision about which production rule to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's suppose that the current nonterminal is A and the next token of input is t. If you know the productions of A, which one would you choose to apply? There's one simple case to consider: if there's a production of the form A → tω, where ω is some arbitrary string, then you should pick that production because the t you're looking at as input will match the t at the front of the production.\n",
        "There are also some complex cases to consider. Suppose you have a production of the form A → Bω, where B is a nonterminal and ω is some string. Under what circumstances would you want to guess this production? Well, if you know that the next terminal symbol is a t, you wouldn't want to guess this production unless you knew that B can expand to a string that starts with the terminal t (there's another case that we'll talk about in a second). This is where FIRST sets come in. In grammars without ε productions, the set FIRST(X) for some nonterminal X is the set of all terminals that can potentially appear at the start of some string derived from X. If you have a production of the form A → Bω and you see the nonterminal t, you'd guess to use that production precisely when t ∈ FIRST(B); that is, B can derive some string that starts with t. If B doesn't derive anything starting with t, then there's no reason to choose it, and if B does derive something starting with t, you'd want to make this choice so that you could eventually match the t against it.\n",
        "Things get a bit trickier when ε productions are introduced. Now, let's suppose that you have a production of the form A → BCω, where B and C are nonterminal and ω is a string. Let's also suppose the next token of input is t. If t ∈ FIRST(B), then we'd choose this production, as mentioned above. However, what happens if t ∉ FIRST(B)? If there are ε productions in the grammar, we might still want to choose this production if B can derive ε and t ∈ FIRST(C).\n",
        "\n",
        "Why is this? If this happens, it means that we might be able to match the t by producing BCω, then producing ε from B, leaving Cω against which to match the t. This is one context where we might have to \"look through\" a nonterminal. Fortunately, this is handled by FIRST sets. If a nonterminal X can produce ε, then ε ∈ FIRST(X). Therefore, we can use FIRST sets to check whether we need to \"look through\" a nonterminal by seeing whether ε ∈ FIRST(X).\n",

It turns out there's still a way that we can eat up that t. Remember that LL (1) parsers work by maintaining a workspace with a string in it. It's possible that the t we're looking at is not supposed to be matched against the current nonterminal A at all, and instead we're supposed to have A produce ε and then let some later nonterminal in the workspace match against the t. This is where FOLLOW sets come in.\n",

        "The FOLLOW set of a nonterminal X, denoted FOLLOW(X), is the set of all terminal symbols that can appear immediately after X in some derivation.
